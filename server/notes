1. Initialize ClientDirectory
2. Spin up server thread 
        - listens for new connections, starts new connection threads. 

3. The rest is for Threadpool:
	- Threadpool is there for launching and cleaning up after threads 
	- Maybe also for storing running threads for reference... perhaps by 
	  admin utilities. 	
	
	New Connection: short-living login thread
		- creates client object
		- spawns listener thread 

	Listener: long-living thread 
		- mapped to client object (Not necessary. See below) 
		- all messages handled on demand
		- call to recvMsg() has timeout (long amount) that if triggered, 
		  prompts an outgoing test from server (on failure, client is removed) 
		- messages are sent through direct call to clientdir or some kind of  
		  thread safe utilities, which will throw an exception if the recipient
		  has been removed
